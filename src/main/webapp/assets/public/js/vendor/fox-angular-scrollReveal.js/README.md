# Angular [scrollReveal.js](http://scrollrevealjs.org/) Directive

Installation
------------
> **Disclaimer:** scrollReveal.js is in early development, and breaking changes will likely occur in future updates. Before updating, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/julianlloyd/scrollReveal.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

#### Download
[master.zip](https://github.com/orapouso/fox-angular-scrollReveal.js/archive/master.zip)

#### GitHub
`git clone https://github.com/orapouso/fox-angular-scrollReveal.js.git`

#### Bower
`bower install fox-angular-scrollReveal.js`

***
Load script after scrollReveal's

```html
  <script src="path/to/scrollReveal.js"></script>
  <script src="path/to/fox-angular-scrollReveal.js"></script>
```

Include module dependency

```javascript
  angular.module('myApp', ['fox.scrollReveal']);
```

Basic Usage
-----------
Needs a custom attribute on the container of all elements so it can start the controller. With that you can also inject your custom defaults.
```html
<div data-sr-container="{ custom defaults }">
  <!-- Same as scrollReveal's basic usage. -->
  <div data-sr="enter left and move 50px over 1.33s"> Foo </div>
  <div data-sr="enter from the bottom after 1s"> Bar </div>
  <div data-sr="wait 2.5s and then ease-in-out 100px"> Baz </div>
</div>
```

Other than that it works just like the normal [scrollReveal.js](http://scrollrevealjs.org/) would. There is a "scroll-reveal" attribute directive, but it does not mess with the original custom attribute from scrollReveal.js. It is only used to register the element with the controller.

Documentation
-------------
Refer to [scrollReveal.js's docs](https://github.com/julianlloyd/scrollReveal.js) to set your custom defaults or animation parameters

#### Special Thanks
To Julian for this awesome library

This directive was inspired by [angular-masonry](https://github.com/passy/angular-masonry)
